    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>Hello everyone,</p>

    <p> <p>My name is Yashi Sharma. I am from Delhi. I have recently completed 12th grade in Science.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursuing B.tech in ELCE at ABES Enginering College.</p> 
        
        <p>I would describe myself as a motivated and curious learner who is eager to explore new</p>
        <p>opportunities and challenges. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a keen</p>
        <p>interest in programming and buisness studies. My strenghts include adaptibility,</p>
        <p>time-management, and the ability to work both independently and as part of a team.</p> 
        <p>I strongly believe in continuous growth and self-improvememt,and I strive to learn</p>
        <p>something new everyday.</p>

        <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy engaging in activities that help me relax and enhance my creativity.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include playing outdoor games like Badminton, Cricket, Football etc. and also</p> 
        <p>exploring technology. These activities not only keep me balanced but also improve my ability to</p>
        <p>think critically and creatively. I am also passionate about developing my communication skills</p>
        <p>and leadership qualities, as I believe these are essential for both personal and professional</p>
        <p>growth.</p>

        <p>My short term goal is to perform well in my current academic journey and actively participate in</p> 
        <p>various projects, workshops and extracurricular activities. My long term goal is to build a</p> 
        <p>successful career in software developement while also contributing positively to society.</p>

        <p>I see myself as an enthusiastic individual who is ready to embrace new experiences, make meaningful</p> 
        <p>connections, and continuously work toward becoming a better version of myself.</p>

        <p>Thankyou</p>
    </p>
